## [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return _the reversed list_.

#### Example 1:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,4,3,2,5]
</pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [5]
</pre>

#### Constraints:

-   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
-   `1 <= n <= 500`
-   `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
-   `1 <= left <= right <= n`
