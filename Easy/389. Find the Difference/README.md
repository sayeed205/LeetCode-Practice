## [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

#### Example 1:

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
<strong>Output:</strong> "e"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 'e' is the letter that was added.
</pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "", t = "y"
<strong>Output:</strong> "y"
</pre>

#### Constraints:

-   `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `t.length == s.length + 1`
-   `s` and `t` consist of lower-case English letters.
